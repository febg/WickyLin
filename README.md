### Compiling the project 

1. You will need to create a `Firebase` project and download your own `GoogleService-Info.plist`. Point its location in Ultility inspector. 

2. Make your own environment variable name `slack-webhook` (string value), this is the web hook for sending a message to a slack channel after successfully passing an English test.
> Something like this: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
